KKKKK

What are we doing:


  - Ports in front of plug  -- Done, but potentially there is hidden faff

  - Clearing out all that tween shit  -- I think done

  - realigning plugs and port holes. -- Done ?

  - The buttons - They're there, but atm they don't appear/dissaer, or click - They do now click -- ima say done




  - creating the new routes div. - Sort of kinda done, but has spawned further issues

  - Salt sim doesn't render connections if it's closed and reopened. -- Dealt with

  - neurons no longer highlighting connections on mouseover in saltsim, i think due to networkmenu being in front reli 
      somat about the fact it's a table maybe 07/09/2023

        Resolved :DDD But new issue have spawned. Just around repositioning elements.

  - Fak repositioning is going to fuk on different screens, cus the buttons are vw, and the sim is px
      - Dealt with this a little, but potentially there is quite a lot more to do to deal with completely.

  - The white space at the bottom, somat to do with salt sim  -- Dealt Withhhh

  - Salt sim crashes if you set the main slider to 0.

  - Neural Mouse hover connection highlight dies on salt run. due to rerendering connections (i think)

  - Make an about page

  - Make the audioBook Page

  - Center everything properly
      - Attempts have been made, but still more to do

  - Make it so the plug plugs in if the plug is touching anywhere on the port img.

  - Make sure the matter stuff is turned off when it isn't in use/generally deal with the lag.
