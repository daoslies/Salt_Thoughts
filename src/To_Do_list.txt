KKKKK

What are we doing:


  - Ports in front of plug  -- Done, but potentially there is hidden faff

  - Clearing out all that tween shit  -- I think done

  - realigning plugs and port holes. -- Done ?

  - The buttons - They're there, but atm they don't appear/dissaer, or click - They do now click -- ima say done




  - creating the new routes div. - Sort of kinda done, but has spawned further issues

  - Salt sim doesn't render connections if it's closed and reopened. -- Dealt with

  - neurons no longer highlighting connections on mouseover in saltsim, i think due to networkmenu being in front reli 
      somat about the fact it's a table maybe 07/09/2023

        Resolved :DDD But new issue have spawned. Just around repositioning elements.

  - Fak repositioning is going to fuk on different screens, cus the buttons are vw, and the sim is px
      - Dealt with this a little, but potentially there is quite a lot more to do to deal with completely. -- Pretty much done now 14/03/2024

  - The white space at the bottom, somat to do with salt sim  -- Dealt Withhhh

  - Salt sim crashes if you set the main slider to 0. -- dealt with

  - Neural Mouse hover connection highlight dies on salt run. due to rerendering connections (i think)

  - Make an about page

  - Make the audioBook Page

  - Center everything properly
      - Attempts have been made, but still more to do

  - Make it so the plug plugs in if the plug is touching anywhere on the port img.

  - Make sure the matter stuff is turned off when it isn't in use/generally deal with the lag.





  ----------------------

  06/02/2024 -- Coming back to this after christmas. All the NaViOli stuff is being fun and lovely (tho vi is not messsaging much and that is causing insecurity)


  Right so, What are we doing:

    -- Just fixed the colours in the graph and targets. --- TICKTICKTICK

    -- Www. kills the dns or something. 

    -- Screen spacing :'(

      -- Salt size - yes, I think

      -- learning r89 slider
 
      -- Output neurons being weird sometimes -- I think dealt with?

      -- That input neuron doesnt render any copnnections sometimes the bastard -- Maybe these are just 0 weight connex

      -- on certain sizes the neurons and wires are close, but not 100% aligned. - better, but still faffy

    -- Mobile clicks

        -- Routing has a solution.  :D :D :D

        -- Need to double check all the other clicks 

              -- wire in audio. 
              -- Alllll The shit in salt sim :'(
              -- Book
              -- About menu.

    -- Finish off the about page text

    -- Compress all the big assets

    -- THe extended / urls don't work.  (which is big bolox) --- Dealt with -- Error file in kinsta set to index.html




    -- Recording the chapter/editing the chapter/is this even the right chapter.

    -- Maybe the welcome in network.js is the source of the lag.




    -------------

    05/-3/2024 -- Cleaning up wires -- In aid of adaptively resizing salt sim

      -- There seems to be 2 wires for the update neurons (at least the first layer, going in for further schekcs)
         
         -- Skooshing up and down on the sliders produces lots of extra wwires.
        
            -- Presumably some of these don't get resized which is what causes the fukkery when resizing.

            -- ctrl-f to 'remove'. The print (filter for 'bodies') is at salt_sim line 475.

      -- Seperately the first sample of salts also don't seem to get removed. - Dealt


      -- Cleaning seems to sort of be dealt with.

      -- Scaling of neurons on resize is being weird -- I think Is dealt.

      1 * 0.5 = 0.5

      1 * 1 = 1

      0.5 * 1 = 0.5

      0.5 * 2 = 1

      -- positioning of input and output neurons (mostly output) is being weird.  -- Think is dealt 



-----------

--- I think we're into the home straights now (maybe 06/03/2024)


  --  Book page resize for screens  -- Done TICK TICK

      -- Could be some arrows on the book page on mobile to demonstrate you need to click left or right.
        And you do conveniently have some arrows preloaded and a mobile trigger on that page now.
          -- Tick Tick

  ---  AUdio page resize for mobile  - Sort of kinda mostly done

      -- Touching the controls currently moves the wire on mobile. should deal with that.
        - Dealt with that.

  -- neuron controls

      -- Control panel should be right of the nested div (or one of the divs that is the right size anyway) -- THink dealt





-- Yo or, ya know, Could just add some more fukkin features -- 20/03/2024

  -- Maybe do an accessability page.
  
  -- About page stuff

  -- Flippin Illium's note.

  -- ANNNNDdd we're back to salt sim

    -- The weights/bias graphs.

        - This is nice as a feature and really is mostly done, just needs some positioning stuff.
    
    -- On salt load they are messy. MESSSY. Mess.

    -- The highlighting of output neurons on accuracy plot have weird buggyness when adding fresh neurons.

          -- Tick, but there's still some mild stuff with mobile screen size.


  -- A video Demo.
