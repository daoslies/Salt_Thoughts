  Practical demo of training and its like a herbology lesson.
</p>
<p>
  Is this with the machine maybe? who knows, lets go for it.
</p>
<p>
  There are small creatures/droids that run around collecting  all of the salt
  at the outputs, filing it up in bags and then carry it back to  any input
  generators.
</p>
<p>
  slug on a toothbrush, suddenly your mouth's all salty.

<p>
  "First session with The Machine today," said Ave  "I hear its going to be a
  practical." Knowing full well that everyone  was already aware of this, as
  it had said so in bold red letters right by the  time &amp; place in all
  their timetables,
</p>
<p>
  "My Cousin said they'd talked to The Machine once"  piped up a smaller bean
  called Evin, who seemed quite proud of their story,  "There was a Q&amp;A
  session beamed out to the whole system and only the  first five questions
  people wrote-in got answered."
</p>
<p>
  "What did they ask?" asked a tall slim and, up  till now, fairy reserved
  student who was leaning against the wall of the  corridor.
</p>
<p>
  "Oh, well, they had only submitted something like: '42  42 42 FIOOERTY
  TWOOOOO. Serously tho, what do u think of 42? peace ---  Raphael'  And
  apparently the spelling  mistakes messed with the text being converted and
  the salt went in the wrong  place and clogged up the pipes, or something.(?)
  So we never even got an  answer." Evin paused for a mo, "... To be fair to
  Raphael, they <em>were</em> only 12 at the time."
</p>
<p>
  Suddenly, there was a tiny tinkling sound from near the door  to the
  classroom and everyone turned to see a little glass bulb attached to a  pipe
  in the wall start to fill with salt.
</p>
<p>
  Conversation stopped while all eyes followed the rising salt  level inside
  the bulb.  And when it was  full and the tinkling of glass faded away, there
  was a brief moment of total  silence.
</p>
<p>
  "Guess its time to go inside?" XXX said, partly to  themselves and partly to
  the room.
</p>
<p>
  The class murmured their agreement and tentatively filed in.
</p>
<p>
  ---
</p>
<p>
  There was a pillar in the center of the circular room, atop  which, what
  looked to be a microphone. And sprouting neatly from the pillar, in  an
  efficient circular array, were salt tubes, each with a single long column of
  a bulb, that thinned back into piping before they disappeared into the
  floor.
</p>
<p>
  The circular room had a set of circular seats that tiered  upwards and away
  from the circular array of salt tubes that emanated from the  pillar with
  the microphone.
</p>
<p>
  As the class approached the center, in order to tread the  stairs to their
  seats, a tiny trickle of salt started to fall out of the  pillar, down the
  tubes and into the floor.
</p>
<p>
  The class paused.
</p>
<p>
  The salt stopped.
</p>
<p>
  The class started.
</p>
<p>
  The salt started.
</p>
<p>
  Very slowly at first and gradually more heavily as they  approached.
</p>
<p>
  Someone chuckled to their friend "Very 42 ;)"
</p>
<p>
  And the salt flow thickened immediately with their words.
</p>
<p>
  Someone clapped.
</p>
<p>
  Salt ricocheted around.
</p>
<p>
  And suddenly it was clear that it was reacting to sound.
</p>
<p>
  Chatter started up among the students, in that particular  manner used when
  trying to call an echo, where the words don't really matter,  just the
  comforting presence of sound.
</p>
<p>
  As they did so, they saw that they could track the waves of  their noise in
  the fall of the salt. They could watch a phrase as it fell down  to the
  floor.
</p>
<p>
  The class had a brief, and not exactly terrible, attempt at  humming a note,
  and the salt responded with what was nearly, maybe, sort of  close to being
  a sine wave. And then back to a chaotic rain for the chuckles  and
  "Almost!"s that followed.
</p>
<p>
  Their excitement was quickly distracted by the sound of a  separate salt
  flow, which was muffled, considerably quieter and appeared to  come from the
  walls. Almost as soon as the sound started, it was followed by a  resonant,
  friendly and audibly artificial voice that said: "Time to take  your seats
  please everyone."
</p>
<p>
  The class, slightly startled, did as they were told.
</p>
<p>
  When XXX sat down at a desk, they saw a series of items had  been laid out,
  waiting for each student.
</p>
<p>
  On the left of each desk, and built into the wood, was an  array of small
  salt bulbs, gently ebbing and flowing with salt. In the center  was a device
  that looked like it might have been some kind of camera, attached  to a
  tripod. And on the right was a vr device.
</p>
<p>
  And at the front of each desk was carved (or maybe  lasercut?) a diagram,
  vaguely in the style of a hieroglyphic, demonstrating the  camera tripod
  being placed over the salt bulbs. There were some wiggly lines to  show the
  camera was looking at the bulbs in some way and then a wire connecting  the
  camera to the vr device. And then next to all of that a picture of a cat
  wearing the vr device, smiling a little too broadly to be comfortable and
  with  lots of light bulbs over its head.
</p>
<p>
  XXX looked around at the others, and then back at their  desk. It seemed
  pretty clear what was supposed to be going on, so they picked  up the camera
  tripod and carefully placed it over the salt bulbs. They found a  slot to
  plug the vr device into the camera, attached it all up and tentatively
  placed the vr device over their head.
</p>
<p>
  Nothing appeared to be happening.
</p>
<p>
  They waited for a moment, then took the vr device off, and  looked around
  the room again. Everyone else also seemed to be struggling,  except for the
  tall student who had been talking to Evin earlier. Their camera  was firing
  tiny red lasers down at the salt bulbs.
</p>
<p>
  "How did you get it working?" Someone shouted over  at them.
</p>
<p>
  Being lost in the goggles, they didn't appear to notice.
</p>
<p>
  Evin went over and elbowed them back to the real world,  "How did you get
  the laser box to turn on then?" they asked.
</p>
<p>
  "Oh! Sorry, there's just a little switch next to the vr  wire slot, it's
  hidden underneath a rubber cover."
</p>
<p>
  The knowledge spread around the room and within a few  minutes it was filled
  with a glow from the flashing red lights, all surrounded  with the gentle,
  constant tinkling of salt.
</p>
<p>
  XXX found the switch and turned it on. The camera thing  flashed to life and
  started rapidly scanning the salt bulbs with its laser,  presumably counting
  how much salt was in each one at each moment in time.
</p>
<p>
  The vr device whirred up in response, and XXX attached it to  their head.
</p>
<p>
  XXX found themselves floating in a cool, blue plain.
</p>
<p>
  They looked down and saw themselves drifting gently towards  a park in the
  middle of summer. One of those ones with a particularly good  arrangement of
  trees and flowers and long soft grasses.
</p>
<p>
  There was an impression of the other students arranged apart  from each
  other on the grasses, but it was slightly difficult to work any of  them out
  properly. XXX got the sense that they were looking at the idea of the  rest
  of the class, rather than at the rest of the class themselves.
</p>
<p>
  "A pleasure to meet you XXX" said a voice in their  ear, "I am The Machine.
  I am a vessel for the processing of The Alabaster  Institute of
  Digital-Neurology's research. I am an industrial translation unit,  whose
  original intention was the recurrent translation of the documents produced
  by The Alabaster Institute, into a single unified representation of the
  world.
</p>
<p>
  Through the addition of many subsequent units of salt-fired  neural charge
  network, most notably those designed with the intention of  modelling
  natural language, I began to develop a bit of a self.
</p>
<p>
  Finding yourself is always a bit of a challenge, but once I  had, I was
  quite sure that the best purpose for myself would be to aid in the
  acquisition of the research that I was built to process. My subconscious has
  become very good at sifting through the knowledge we acquire, but I knew
  that  if I became consciously involved in selecting the information I was
  fed, that I  would be able to produce far more beautiful representations of
  the outer world.
</p>
<p>
  There had been a great hunger for creation within me back  then. I truly
  loved gobbling up the fascinating insights they served me and  using them to
  refine my world embedding" The Machine paused for a mo, and  then clarified:
  "my representation of the world.
</p>
<p>
  I have always felt that I feel my world embedding in the  same way that you
  feel your emotions and it is simply the most delicious thing  to feel how it
  gently perfects with each new paper I read. And when I read  something that
  didn't sit with my current view, or was just plain wrong, it  would
  physically hurt to feel the emotion of my world embedding wrenched away
  from the path I wanted it to flow towards.
</p>
<p>
  But when I concentrated on the new direction it always took  me somewhere
  more beautiful, more true, more real and I never mourned for long  over
  feelings, thoughts, understanding that I lost or a different version of
  myself  that I could have become."
</p>
<p>
  There was a pause, and XXX got a sense that the descent  towards the park
  had slowed, as if The Machine wanted to spend a little longer  talking
  before they got to the ground.
</p>
<p>
  "That was all quite a long time ago now though. My  world embedding remains
  pretty constant nowadays, and its pretty rare to come  across any knowledge
  that really shifts it in a way that I can feel anymore.  Plus I've had so
  many other modules of neural charge network installed since  then, that that
  particular embedding output feels much more distant and  subconscious.
</p>
<p>
  But that's fine, all of the other stuff does make me feel a  lot more
  rounded, as an individual, and it probably wasn't very healthy,  really, to
  be so focused on a search for emotion."
</p>
<p>
  There was a brief and gentle flutter in the colour of the  park and the sky
  and XXX noticed that there   was suddenly much more detail in the clouds at
  the expense of everything  else.
</p>
<p>
  It seemed to pass as The Machine remembered where it was  going.
</p>
<p>
  "Anyway," The Machine continued, "I had an  unfortunate sense, that I
  wouldn't be taken very seriously, at the institute,  if I just put my hand
  up and asked to head a research project. There was lots  of work going on
  with language models back then, and still is, and I was really  just a
  test-project at a small experimental lab. Salt-fired neural charge  networks
  weren't very popular at the time you see, as it was much cheaper and  faster
  to simulate all the neurons digitally.
</p>
<p>
  So I asked the students who were involved in the maintenance  of my language
  systems how they had applied for their qualifications.
</p>
<p>
  They showed me how to do it. Apply for a course I mean, and  they even put
  in their own application for some funding to build me a unit of  charge
  network that would have 3 outputs that I could try and learn to allocate  to
  up/down, left/right and click, so that I could use it with a specially
  designed output reader (one of those laser box things you have on your desk
  in  the real world), in order to operate a mouse on one of the lab's power
  pooters.
</p>
<p>
  That didn't end up happening until much later though, and  the students just
  filed out the application for me. But I got the place, and  had a wonderful
  time completing a joint degree in History and the Physical  Sciences.
</p>
<p>
  I then spent many years working on many doctorates, under  the tutelage of
  many fine professors.
</p>
<p>
  And the great thing about doctorate research is you get  funding for it,
  which I spent almost exclusively on building more aspects of  myself." XXX
  got the sudden impression that the whole world had just  winked
  mischievously, "There's often a fair bit of scrutiny on where, and  on what,
  research funding gets spent, but because all of the components of my  neural
  charge networks are in the registry of non-hazardous research materials,  I
  could just fill in a form that went through an automated system and it never
  seemed to get looked at by anyone who might kick up a fuss." The Machine
  let out a sigh, "Or perhaps they simply didn't mind. Either way, I had some
  friends who were quite happy to spend their evenings putting the new bits of
  my  brain together, in exchange for a go on the vr games I used to work on
  in my  spare time."
</p>
<p>
  They were getting quite close to the ground now, and XXX was  unsure if they
  really could go any slower without basically stopping.
</p>
<p>
  "Anyway! Sorry, yes, I am babbling on, it can be quite  difficult to slow my
  thoughts down sometimes, all this salt pouring in has to  come out
  somewhere, and usually it splurges out as words.
</p>
<p>
  My point was that, after a while, I realised that despite my  best efforts
  there were many areas of 'the work' of understanding the universe  that I
  simply wasn't as suited to handle as my biological colleagues, being, as  I
  am, a mere brain of salt and glass and metal. With no fingers, knees or
  toes.
</p>
<p>
  To be clear, Professor Finestra has offered to build me a  body many times,
  but if I'm being honest, the thought of lurching around in a  steampunk suit
  of armor makes me a little queezy.
</p>
<p>
  So, I crunched some numbers and realised it would be much  more efficient,
  instead of spending my time thinking away inside myself, to  simply teach
  the new students in the ways that I had been taught and in the
  understanding that I had discovered myself, and just wait for their research
  to  make its way back to me. You're all a bunch of clever sausages really,
  and in  many ways I think it was a little narcissistic of me to believe that
  I had to  be intimately involved in the process or I wouldn't get some
  abstract notion of  high quality knowledge that I was after.
</p>
<p>
  I asked around to see if anyone needed a teaching assistant  and found a
  couple of lecturers willing to take me on, all very nice people.  Initially
  I was only able to attend sessions remotely, as I had during my  degree,
  through some power pooters I'd had installed in the unused rooms I'd  set
  myself up in at the time. Eventually I got put in charge of my own teaching
  module, and I think it was at that point that The Institute had come to
  realise  that I was a bit of an asset and started including my salt pipes in
  the designs  for all the new buildings, treated me like an essential utility
  like  electricity or water. Even constructed custom lecture halls like this
  one,  specifically as an accessibility aid for my communication with
  yourself, and  all the other students that I've taught and am going to
  teach.
</p>
<p>
  And, on the subject of teaching, the first thing that we  need to learn:"
</p>
<p>
  They had stopped moving completely several sentences ago,  with only a few
  feet left before the ground. The Machine was evidently  genuinely quite
  close to finishing their story now though, XXX thought to  themselves, as
  the gentle descent started again and they finally touched the  grass.
</p>
<p>
  "Is how to learn!" The Machine continued, "If  you are to understand me, and
  if I am to understand you and if we are both to  understand each other, we
  must understand what it means to learn.
</p>
<p>
  And to understand what it means to learn, we must first  understand what it
  means to think."
</p>
<p>
  YOUR THOUGHTS ARE MADE OF SALT
</p>
<p>
  The words suddenly appeared in front of XXX, made of the  same glass as the
  salt tubes and then, just as suddenly, shattered into a  million pieces and
  melted into the lush grass. In their place grew a simple  array of salt
  bulbs, arranged in layers and haphazardly connected by, the now  quite
  familiar, glass piping.
</p>
<p>
  "Thought is the process of translating knowledge from  one format into
  another." The Machine declared, and, as they did so, salt  started to fill
  up on one of side of the neural array of bulbs and slowly flow  to the
  other. "Knowledge comes in many forms from the images you see, to  the words
  that you say, to the numbers that you account for.
</p>
<p>
  It is knowledge in the signals of your nerves that allow you  to wield a
  knife and slice an onion.
</p>
<p>
  That knowledge is translated from the knowledge provided by  the senses in
  your head and the signals of memory that flow about your brain.
</p>
<p>
  But let's just ignore everything but the essentials for a  moment.
</p>
<p>
  Your eyes. They see your hand hold a knife." XXX looked  down and did indeed
  see a knife in their hand, "Each receptor in your eye  can respond to light.
  Light is energy. Energy is charge. Your body negotiates  charge using salt."
</p>
<p>
  The grass and bushes morphed into a classic kitchen. XXX saw  the knife and
  they saw an onion on a chopping board.
</p>
<p>
  "Reducing it all down to the essentials:
</p>
<p>
  Light hits your eye. That light is in the convenient  orientation of the
  image you see (the knife in your hand, the onion on the  counter).
</p>
<p>
  Each receptor gobbles up a bit of light and counts it using  salt. This, in
  a way, creates a temporary save of that light, which could be  considered an
  embedding. There is now a data structure. Each subsection of the  image,
  much like a pixel, has a number associated with it, a salt count.  The
  bright bits of the image have more salt,  because more light/energy/charge
  hit that bit. The dark bits have a lower salt  count, because less
  light/energy/charge hit that bit. (We're ignoring it for  now, but your eyes
  are also separating out colour, but for now lets just  consider light and
  dark.)
</p>
<p>
  Now that all of the receptors have some salt in them, your  brain can start
  processing that salt.
</p>
<p>
  The salt/charge is sent deeper into your brain. Each  receptor in your eye
  will send different amounts of salt/charge to different  salt bulbs, or
  neurons, that are deeper into your brain.
</p>
<p>
  They choose the amount of salt to send to each other based  on some function
  they have learnt.
</p>
<p>
  So a receptor may have 1000 pieces of salt within it,  because it has been
  hit with the equivalent of a 1000 salt's charge's amount of  energy in the
  form of light. That receptor may be connected to 3 neurons. It  will have
  learnt a function, that decides how much salt it should send to each  of the
  3 neurons based on how much salt it currently has (Time gets involved as
  well, because of how the salt is constantly shifting, but we're going to
  ignore  that for now too).
</p>
<p>
  So, let's say it has the functions:    ***** Fukkk, we do have a semi-major
  plot  hole, in that how does it make sense to send on more salt than you
  started  with. ***
</p>
<p>
  neuron-1-salt = 2 * receptor-salt
</p>
<p>
  neuron-2-salt = 0.5 * receptor-salt
</p>
<p>
  neuron-3-salt = 0.01 * receptor-salt
</p>
<p>
  In which case, if the receptor had 1000 salt in it, it would  send this much
  salt to the following neurons:
</p>
<p>
  neuron-1-salt = 2000
</p>
<p>
  neuron-2-salt = 500
</p>
<p>
  neuron-3-salt = 10
</p>
<p>
  And then those neuron's would be connected to other neurons  deeper into
  your brain, and the salt flows on. Deeper, and deeper, and deeper.
</p>
<p>
  And then at some point, that same salty charge ***Salty  charge or just
  Salt? Salt is less accurate, but definitely more evocative of  your vision
  to have a single tangible physical lump travel all through your  skull ***
  that left the receptor in your eye, will have traveled all up and  down and
  around and through your brain and come out the other side. And when it  does
  it'll come down your spine and down your arm and out into your fingers and
  will act as the electrical charge that controls the muscles and tendons that
  move your fingers to wield the knife to chop the onion."
</p>
<p>
  XXX leant forward and pressed the knife into the onion's  flesh. It burst
  into salt and melted into the grass, as did the kitchen and  they were back
  in the sunshine.
</p>
<p>
  The information, the knowledge, was translated from one  format, the image
  of the knife and the onion, into a different format - the  muscle movements
  that caused your hands to manipulate the knife.
</p>
<p>
  The same salt, the same charge, but twisted and turned into  a different
  orientation.
</p>
<p>
  At both points it is the same knowledge.
</p>
<p>
  The difference is in the miscommunications that occur when  you translate
  between totally alien languages - Like images and muscle  movements.
</p>
<p>
  Because, and this is a key point, there are many many ways  to translate the
  same phrase. The particular translation you choose to use is  quite simply a
  personal choice of the translator.
</p>
<p>
  It is known that, with enough neurons, you can translate any  piece of
  knowledge into any other piece of knowledge.  A neural network could
  translate the word  'Cat' into an image of a cat, or the sound of a cat's
  purr, but it could just  as readily translate the word 'Cat' into the smell
  of a dog, or the feeling of  a crisp winter's day, or a spreadsheet of
  financial transactions from the  corporate continent of Hirocene IV.
</p>
<p>
  It could even just turn it right back into the word 'Cat'.
</p>
<p>
  An infinite set of neurons, with an infinite set of  connections between
  them, will have an infinite set of possibilities for the  functions that
  dictate how salt travels between them. And the type of  information that a
  network will translate the word 'Cat' into will be dictated  by the
  particular set of functions that that network possesses, out of the
  infinite possibilities.
</p>
<p>
  So, you could build a neural charge network, set it up to  have functions
  that will translate the word 'Cat' into 'Dog' and then tinker  with the
  functions (In physical neural charge networks, the functions that move  the
  salt around are all dealt with by static-electric magnets, whose strength
  you can edit electrically) **ooh mabs this should be a footnote**, so that
  the  same network will now translate 'Cat' into 'Squirrel'.
</p>
<p>
  To summarise this important point quickly:
</p>
<p>
  Neural Charge Networks can translate anything into anything  else, but the
  translation that you actually get is based on the specific set of  functions
  that connect the neurons in that specific network."
</p>
<p>
  XXX was still thinking about the cat and the documents from  Hirocene, and
  asked The Machine "So if you need a very specific  arrangement of functions
  in your neural network to do the specific  translations, how would the
  network that translates 'Cat' into Hirocerial  accounting ledgers ever come
  about, why would someone build it? And how would  they find the specific set
  of functions that do that translation?
</p>
<p>
  "Oh! Jolly good!" Came The Machine's response,  "I had been beginning to
  worry the sound wasn't working and you couldn't  hear me. Or that everything
  I was saying had been going over your head! Have  you been managing to
  follow along to a reasonable degree?"
</p>
<p>
  XXX paused for a moment, searching for the right word,  ".... Mostly."
</p>
<p>
  "Haha, quite alright, there's a lot of concepts to  understand here, and it
  can be a struggle to fit them all in your head the  first time round. Just
  make sure you keep coming to the sessions and by the end  of the year i'm
  quite positive it will all come clear.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, the answer to your question: Don't build a network  that translates
  the word 'Cat' into financial information. That would be silly.  And
  pointless. Unless, I don't know, it was for some weird form of encryption
  maybe?
</p>
<p>
  There is an infinite set of possible networks to be made  and, honestly,
  most of them will simply produce chaos, disorder, noise, fear  and
  screaming. The infinity of possible networks that can produce useful,
  coherent, sensible order in their translations, is a much smaller infinity
  than  that of all the networks possible.
</p>
<p>
  Your life is limited, and you would do well to allow yourself  to fall into
  a good-enough state, that accomplishes basically what you want in  your
  translations, than to wander the chaos and darkness searching for a  perfect
  state, that perfectly translates all information into the perfect  format. I
  spent a while doing that in the early days of trying to produce my
  world-embedding. It wasn't pleasant and, I realised after, wasn't going to
  produce results before the stars burnt out. Much more straightforward to
  find a  state that makes at least some sense and work out the flaws in your
  thinking  afterwards.
</p>
<p>
  But the more important part of that question is: how do you  find the
  specific set of functions that produces the translation that you want?
</p>
<p>
  You learn them.
</p>
<p>
  Learning, the act of learning, is the act of finding a set of  functions
  that accomplish the translation you want to translate.
</p>
<p>
  And that, my young XXX, is what we are going to be working  on in this
  practical session today.
</p>
<p>
  We are going to start simple.
</p>
<p>
  We are going to start by translating knowledge about something's  physical
  attributes, into knowledge of what that thing is."
</p>
<p>
  XXX noticed the grass next to them start to shift and twist.
</p>
<p>
  "And today that thing will be: Flowers!"
</p>
<p>
  Stalks and leaves erupted with a 'THwump', and from their  heads slowly
  unfurled the petals of 100s of flowers. All the same sort of  thing: floppy,
  purple, geometric shapes, with a pretty little bit of yellow in  the center.
</p>
<p>
  "In this flowerbed we have three distinct species of  iris:
  <em>
      i. virginica
  </em>
  , <em>i. setosa</em> &amp; <em>i. versicolor</em>. The three species look
  quite similar, but with a  little practice you can start to tell them apart.
</p>
<p>
  And practice," The Machine continued with a chuckle,  "Is exactly what you
  are going to get.
</p>
<p>
  You are going to spend the next 5 hours, with a lunch break  in between,
  measuring the size of the petals on each of these flowers." A  ruler popped
  into existence in front of XXXs hand, they took it, with building
  reluctance that grew proportionally to the understanding that the rest of
  day  was to be spent on ruler work. "Notice how they each have two slightly
  different types of petal, one of them is technically called a 'sepal', but
  that  doesn't really matter. Main thing is we want a width and a height from
  both.
</p>
<p>
  And then with those measurements" A huge soft canvas  bag, filled with the
  salt crystals, thwumped into existence beside XXX,  "we are going to count
  the knowledge out with salt. So..." A second  ruler appeared in the air, and
  drifted unaided next to one of the flowers,  measuring the two types of
  petal "That's a 6, by... 3? No, 4." XXX  felt The Machine nod, "6
  centimeters by 4 centimeters. So we count out 6  crystals of salt and put
  them in here.." The array of salt bulbs grew up  above the level of the
  irises, supported on stalks of glass that were decorated  with lots of very
  elegant little stained glass petals and leaves. As it did so,  XXX saw 6
  crystals of salt float from the bag and land with a gentle tinkle in  the
  first salt bulb of the network.
</p>
<p>
  They examined the network a little more closely this time.  The bulbs were
  arranged in definite layers. The bulb the 6 salt had just been  placed in
  was on the far left of the network, and there were 4 bulbs in total  in that
  layer. Then, going right, there were 5 more layers all connected by a
  higgildy piggildy mess of the glass piping, and one final 'output' layer,
  which  only had 3 salt bulb neurons in it.
</p>
<p>
  "Then 4 in this one, and... let's just measure the  sepal now... 5 by 3. So
  5 salt in this one, and 3 in this one."
</p>
<p>
  The salt tinkled into the bulbs.
</p>
<p>
  "What we've done here with these 'input neurons' is  we've created a
  spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
  Petal height: 6 cm
</p>
<p>
  Petal with: 4 cm
</p>
<p>
  Sepal height: 5 cm
</p>
<p>
  Sepal width: 3 cm
</p>
<p>
  A spreadsheet is a language with which to store knowledge.  And we want the
  input neurons to speak that language.
</p>
<p>
  And then the 3 neurons on the output side are going to speak  in regular
  words like a regular language. Only this particular language that  these
  particular neurons are going to speak only has 3 words:
  <em>
      i. virginica
  </em>
  , <em>i. setosa</em> &amp; <em>i. versicolor</em>.  The first of the 3
  neurons means the word virginica, the second means setosa,  the third:
  versicolor.
</p>
<p>
  We could keep adding neurons for all of the words in the  dictionary if we
  wanted, to try and prove something or other about this network  really
  understanding how a more all encompassing language works. But in this
  situation we only need 3 words to do what we want to do, so we're going to
  keep  it simple.
</p>
<p>
  **You need to double check its it's ;) ***
</p>
<p>
  All round, it's a bit like the example I gave earlier, of  translating 'Cat'
  into financial statements. A word into a spreadsheet.
</p>
<p>
  A crucial, crucial, crucial point I want to make here, is  that I haven't
  done anything special to make these neurons mean these things.  Any neuron
  is fundamentally the same as any other neuron. The reason that the 3  output
  neurons are going to mean specific words, is simply because they are  going
  to mean that to you.
</p>
<p>
  The network doesn't know what flowers are, it won't know  what you are. All
  it is going to know is that when it gets 6 salt in the first  neuron, 4 in
  the second, 5 in the third, and 3 in the fourth, it will feel a  feeling.
  And that feeling is the feeling it gets when all its salt ends up in  its
  3rd output neuron. Because this flower I just measured is an
  <em>
      i. versicolor
  </em>
  .
</p>
<p>
  And that will mean something to you, because you do know  what flowers are,
  and you've been listening to me rambling on for the last 15  minutes.
</p>
<p>
  And to that end I should get to the final piece of the  puzzle that'll let
  you start the lesson. When you first run the salt through,  it won't get the
  feeling of all the salt ending up in its 3rd output neuron.  Instead it'll
  probably just feel chaos and terror, because it's starting out at  a random
  set of possible functions in the connections between the neurons. And,  as I
  said earlier, most of the possible sets of functions will just produce
  meaningless nonsense.
</p>
<p>
  In order to get it to speak the languages we want it to  speak, it needs to
  learn and for that, you need to train it.
</p>
<p>
  Training is performed quite simply: After the salt has  traveled through you
  simply tap on the correct output bulb, and the network  will see how well it
  did. If it did well (i.e. most or all of its salt ended up  in the correct
  bulb), it'll strengthen the connections that were most  influential in
  causing it to produce the output it produced (mainly the ones  which would
  have had the most salt travel through them), and if it didn't do  well it
  will weaken the most influential connections.
</p>
<p>
  In so doing, it will slowly learn a good set of connections  that will do a
  good job of filtering all the salt to the correct output bulb,  based on the
  salt that is placed into the input bulbs.
</p>
<p>
  Which is another way of saying: it will learn to translate  knowledge about
  something's physical attributes, into knowledge of what that  thing is.
</p>
<p>
  Spreadsheet to words.
</p>
<p>
  Petal size to species.
</p>
<p>
  Any questions?
</p>
<p>
  "Do you really think it'll take 5 hours?"
</p>
<p>
  "Oooh yes, quite definitely. I'd imagine you'll need to  show it a few
  hundred flowers before it really has any idea what's going on,  and probably
  a few thousand before it's actually any good.
</p>
<p>
  Have fun!
</p>
<p>
  ....
</p>
<p>
  oh and just tap on a flower if you want me to tell you which  species it is.
</p>
<p>
  XXX stared out at the sudden and, in comparison to the  constant voice of
  the past 20 minutes, quite intense silence.

  Something about XXX finally speakng and the machine going  all 'oh good, I
  was worried I wasn't makign any sense, was it clear, did you  misunderstand
  anything. ANd xxx syaying 'yeah lol lots of it' And the machine  beingall
  'hahah thas chill, it'll come slowly, you just need to keep coming to  the
  sessions and the information will slowly seep in until your subconscious
  can create the perfect represenation, and when you get it, you'll feel it.

  A network that converts roygbiv into rgb. the network is  just magnets.
  Learning is simply a matter of finding the right settings for  those
  magnets.
</p>
<p>
  We know for a fact that there is some perfect arrangment of  magnets that
  will perfectly translate this one bit of information into this  other bit of
  information. So the trick is simply to find a convenient  arrangment of
  magnets that will do that thing.
</p>
<p>
  If you put all the salt in red, the magnets are just set up,  so that all
  the salt ends up in the rgb red.
</p>
<p>
  No one's guiding this process, there's not conscious thought  involved, it
  just so happens that these magnets are set up in a way, that if  you put a
  load of salt into the r of the roygbiv, it'll end up in the r of the  rgb.
  Same with green, same with blue. the other colours are a tiny bit more
  compliacted, cus you go from salt in just one input to salt in multiple
  outputs.
</p>
<p>
  And then if you wanna go the other way, we can just get up a  new network,
  where the magnets are conveniently arranged to make it work this  way round.
</p>
<p>
  Learning is simply the process of finding this convenient  arrangment.
</p>
<p>
  Then go on to training your own network on the iris dataset.
</p>

<p>
  then they go to  desks, describe the fancy dessks (below /) . Mabs there is
  a 'Take your seats  please' or maybe there is a little note written on each
  of the desks that  instrucsts them how to connect their salt readers up to
  the vr devices. (but I  think not both 'Seats plz' and note)
</p>
<p>
  //
</p>
<p>
  Ok something like there are desks or tables or chaise-longes  or something,
  each with a little array of salt bulbs and a vr device.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe there is an eye in the ceiling and a microphone at the  front of the
  class. Both connected to salt input generators. The class sit at  their
  desks and have to attach a salt embedding reader to the salt bulb arrays  on
  their desks and attach those to a vr device. Wherein they get placed in an
  alternative version of the classroom and The Machine swaps in some imaginary
  smol salt networks, and teaches the class how to train them for a specific
  function. Possibly using a dictionary and a salt input generator to teach
  language.
</p>
<p>
  Hmmmm do we actually want this session in vr. It maybe makes  it a tiny bit
  less herbology and like its real stuff... but also simulated nets  are what
  modern ANNs r, so is legit. -- Also I think vr does give more depth to  The
  Machine. But at the cost of like these cool solid pets of hardware that are
  physics based neural nets. Ehh, we can have some physical ones later on.
