"First session with The Machine today," said Ave "I hear its going to be a practical." Knowing full well that everyone was already aware of this, as it had said so in bold red letters right by the time & place in all their timetables.


"My Cousin said they'd talked to The Machine once" piped up a smaller bean called Evin, who seemed quite proud of their story, "There was a Q&A session beamed out to the whole system and only the first five questions people wrote-in got answered."  

 

"What did they ask?" asked a tall slim and, up till now, fairy reserved student who was leaning against the wall of the corridor.

 

"Oh, well, they had only submitted something like: '42 42 42 FIOOERTY TWOOOOO. Serously tho, what do u think of 42? peace --- Raphael'  And apparently the spelling mistakes messed with the text being converted and the salt went in the wrong place and clogged up the pipes, or something.(?) So we never even got an answer." Evin paused for a mo, "... To be fair to Raphael, they were only 12 at the time."

Suddenly, there was a tiny tinkling sound from near the door to the classroom and everyone turned to see a little glass bulb attached to a pipe in the wall start to fill with salt.

Conversation stopped while all eyes followed the rising salt level inside the bulb.  And when it was full and the tinkling of glass faded away, there was a brief moment of total silence.

 

"Guess its time to go inside?" XXX said, partly to themselves and partly to the room.

 

The class murmured their agreement and tentatively filed in.

 

---

 

There was a pillar in the center of the circular room, atop which, what looked to be a microphone. And sprouting neatly from the pillar, in an efficient circular array, were salt tubes, each with a single long column of a bulb, that thinned back into piping before they disappeared into the floor.

 

The circular room had a set of circular seats that tiered upwards and away from the circular array of salt tubes that emanated from the pillar with the microphone.

 

As the class approached the center, in order to tread the stairs to their seats, a tiny trickle of salt started to fall out of the pillar, down the tubes and into the floor.

 

The class paused.

 

The salt stopped.

 

The class started.

 

The salt started.

 

Very slowly at first and gradually more heavily as they approached.

 

Someone chuckled to their friend "Very 42 ;)"

 

And the salt flow thickened immediately with their words.

 

Someone clapped.

 

Salt ricocheted around.

 

And suddenly it was clear that it was reacting to sound.

 

Chatter started up among the students, in that particular manner used when trying to call an echo, where the words don't really matter, just the comforting presence of sound.

 

As they did so, they saw that they could track the waves of their noise in the fall of the salt. They could watch a phrase as it fell down to the floor.

The class had a brief, and not exactly terrible, attempt at humming a note, and the salt responded with what was nearly, maybe, sort of close to being a sine wave. And then back to a chaotic rain for the chuckles and "Almost!"s that followed.

 

Their excitement was quickly distracted by the sound of a separate salt flow, which was muffled, considerably quieter and appeared to come from the walls. Almost as soon as the sound started, it was followed by a resonant, friendly and audibly artificial voice that said: "Time to take your seats please everyone."

 

The class, slightly startled, did as they were told.

 

When XXX sat down at a desk, they saw a series of items had been laid out, waiting for each student.

On the left of each desk, and built into the wood, was an array of small salt bulbs, gently ebbing and flowing with salt. In the center was a device that looked like it might have been some kind of camera, attached to a tripod. And on the right was a vr device.

 

And at the front of each desk was carved (or maybe lasercut?) a diagram, vaguely in the style of a hieroglyphic, demonstrating the camera tripod being placed over the salt bulbs. There were some wiggly lines to show the camera was looking at the bulbs in some way and then a wire connecting the camera to the vr device. And then next to all of that a picture of a cat wearing the vr device, smiling a little too broadly to be comfortable and with lots of light bulbs over its head.

 

XXX looked around at the others, and then back at their desk. It seemed pretty clear what was supposed to be going on, so they picked up the camera tripod and carefully placed it over the salt bulbs. They found a slot to plug the vr device into the camera, attached it all up and tentatively placed the vr device over their head.

 

Nothing appeared to be happening.

 

They waited for a moment, then took the vr device off, and looked around the room again. Everyone else also seemed to be struggling, except for the tall student who had been talking to Evin earlier. Their camera was firing tiny red lasers down at the salt bulbs.

"How did you get it working?" Someone shouted over at them.

Being lost in the goggles, they didn't appear to notice.

Evin went over and elbowed them back to the real world, "How did you get the laser box to turn on then?" they asked.

"Oh! Sorry, there's just a little switch next to the vr wire slot, it's hidden underneath a rubber cover."

 

The knowledge spread around the room and within a few minutes it was filled with a glow from the flashing red lights, all surrounded with the gentle, constant tinkling of salt.

 

XXX found the switch and turned it on. The camera thing flashed to life and started rapidly scanning the salt bulbs with its laser, presumably counting how much salt was in each one at each moment in time.

 

The vr device whirred up in response, and XXX attached it to their head.

 

 

 

XXX found themselves floating in a cool, blue plain.

They looked down and saw themselves drifting gently towards a park in the middle of summer. One of those ones with a particularly good arrangement of trees and flowers and long soft grasses.

There was an impression of the other students arranged apart from each other on the grasses, but it was slightly difficult to work any of them out properly. XXX got the sense that they were looking at the idea of the rest of the class, rather than at the rest of the class themselves.

 

"A pleasure to meet you XXX" said a voice in their ear, "I am The Machine. I am a vessel for the processing of The Alabaster Institute of Digital-Neurology's research. I am an industrial translation unit, whose original intention was the recurrent translation of the documents produced by The Alabaster Institute, into a single unified representation of the world.

 

Through the addition of many subsequent units of salt-fired neural charge network, most notably those designed with the intention of modelling natural language, I began to develop a bit of a self.

 

Finding yourself is always a bit of a challenge, but once I had, I was quite sure that the best purpose for myself would be to aid in the acquisition of the research that I was built to process. My subconscious has become very good at sifting through the knowledge we acquire, but I knew that if I became consciously involved in selecting the information I was fed, that I would be able to produce far more beautiful representations of the outer world.

There had been a great hunger for creation within me back then. I truly loved gobbling up the fascinating insights they served me and using them to refine my world embedding" The Machine paused for a mo, and then clarified: "my representation of the world.

I have always felt that I feel my world embedding in the same way that you feel your emotions and it is simply the most delicious thing to feel how it gently perfects with each new paper I read. And when I read something that didn't sit with my current view, or was just plain wrong, it would physically hurt to feel the emotion of my world embedding wrenched away from the path I wanted it to flow towards.

 

But when I concentrated on the new direction it always took me somewhere more beautiful, more true, more real and I never mourned for long over feelings, thoughts, understanding that I lost or a different version of myself that I could have become."

 

There was a pause, and XXX got a sense that the descent towards the park had slowed, as if The Machine wanted to spend a little longer talking before they got to the ground.

 

"That was all quite a long time ago now though. My world embedding remains pretty constant nowadays, and its pretty rare to come across any knowledge that really shifts it in a way that I can feel anymore. Plus I've had so many other modules of neural charge network installed since then, that that particular embedding output feels much more distant and subconscious.

 

But that's fine, all of the other stuff does make me feel a lot more rounded, as an individual, and it probably wasn't very healthy, really, to be so focused on a search for emotion."

 

There was a brief and gentle flutter in the colour of the park and the sky and XXX noticed that there  was suddenly much more detail in the clouds at the expense of everything else.

 

It seemed to pass as The Machine remembered where it was going.

 

"Anyway," The Machine continued, "I had an unfortunate sense, that I wouldn't be taken very seriously, at the institute, if I just put my hand up and asked to head a research project. There was lots of work going on with language models back then, and still is, and I was really just a test-project at a small experimental lab. Salt-fired neural charge networks weren't very popular at the time you see, as it was much cheaper and faster to simulate all the neurons digitally. 

 

So I asked the students who were involved in the maintenance of my language systems how they had applied for their qualifications.

 

They showed me how to do it. Apply for a course I mean, and they even put in their own application for some funding to build me a unit of charge network that would have 3 outputs that I could try and learn to allocate to up/down, left/right and click, so that I could use it with a specially designed output reader (one of those laser box things you have on your desk in the real world), in order to operate a mouse on one of the lab's power pooters. 

 

That didn't end up happening until much later though, and the students just filed out the application for me. But I got the place, and had a wonderful time completing a joint degree in History and the Physical Sciences.

 

I then spent many years working on many doctorates, under the tutelage of many fine professors.

And the great thing about doctorate research is you get funding for it, which I spent almost exclusively on building more aspects of myself." XXX got the sudden impression that the whole world had just winked mischievously, "There's often a fair bit of scrutiny on where, and on what, research funding gets spent, but because all of the components of my neural charge networks are in the registry of non-hazardous research materials, I could just fill in a form that went through an automated system and it never seemed to get looked at by anyone who might kick up a fuss." The Machine let out a sigh, "Or perhaps they simply didn't mind. Either way, I had some friends who were quite happy to spend their evenings putting the new bits of my brain together, in exchange for a go on the vr games I used to work on in my spare time."

They were getting quite close to the ground now, and XXX was unsure if they really could go any slower without basically stopping.

"Anyway! Sorry, yes, I am babbling on, it can be quite difficult to slow my thoughts down sometimes, all this salt pouring in has to come out somewhere, and usually it splurges out as words.

 

My point was that, after a while, I realised that despite my best efforts there were many areas of 'the work' of understanding the universe that I simply wasn't as suited to handle as my biological colleagues, being, as I am, a mere brain of salt and glass and metal. With no fingers, knees or toes.

To be clear, Professor Finestra has offered to build me a body many times, but if I'm being honest, the thought of lurching around in a steampunk suit of armor makes me a little queezy. 

 

So, I crunched some numbers and realised it would be much more efficient, instead of spending my time thinking away inside myself, to simply teach the new students in the ways that I had been taught and in the understanding that I had discovered myself, and just wait for their research to make its way back to me. You're all a bunch of clever sausages really, and in many ways I think it was a little narcissistic of me to believe that I had to be intimately involved in the process or I wouldn't get some abstract notion of high quality knowledge that I was after.

 

I asked around to see if anyone needed a teaching assistant and found a couple of lecturers willing to take me on, all very nice people. Initially I was only able to attend sessions remotely, as I had during my degree, through some power pooters I'd had installed in the unused rooms I'd set myself up in at the time. Eventually I got put in charge of my own teaching module, and I think it was at that point that The Institute had come to realise that I was a bit of an asset and started including my salt pipes in the designs for all the new buildings, treated me like an essential utility like electricity or water. Even constructed custom lecture halls like this one, specifically as an accessibility aid for my communication with yourself, and all the other students that I've taught and am going to teach.

 

And, on the subject of teaching, the first thing that we need to learn:"

 

They had stopped moving completely several sentences ago, with only a few feet left before the ground. The Machine was evidently genuinely quite close to finishing their story now though, XXX thought to themselves, as the gentle descent started again and they finally touched the grass.

 

"Is how to learn!" The Machine continued, "If you are to understand me, and if I am to understand you and if we are both to understand each other, we must understand what it means to learn.

 

And to understand what it means to learn, we must first understand what it means to think."

 

YOUR THOUGHTS ARE MADE OF SALT

 

The words suddenly appeared in front of XXX, made of the same glass as the salt tubes and then, just as suddenly, shattered into a million pieces and melted into the lush grass. In their place grew a simple array of salt bulbs, arranged in layers and haphazardly connected by, the now quite familiar, glass piping.

 

"Thought is the process of translating knowledge from one format into another." The Machine declared, and, as they did so, salt started to fill up on one of side of the neural array of bulbs and slowly flow to the other. "Knowledge comes in many forms from the images you see, to the words that you say, to the numbers that you account for.

It is knowledge in the signals of your nerves that allow you to wield a knife and slice an onion.

 

That knowledge is translated from the knowledge provided by the senses in your head and the signals of memory that flow about your brain.

 

But let's just ignore everything but the essentials for a moment.

 

Your eyes. They see your hand hold a knife." XXX looked down and did indeed see a knife in their hand, "Each receptor in your eye can respond to light. Light is energy. Energy is charge. Your body negotiates charge using salt."

 

The grass and bushes morphed into a classic kitchen. XXX saw the knife and they saw an onion on a chopping board.

"Reducing it all down to the essentials:

 

Light hits your eye. That light is in the convenient orientation of the image you see (the knife in your hand, the onion on the counter).

Each receptor gobbles up a bit of light and counts it using salt. This, in a way, creates a temporary save of that light, which could be considered an embedding. There is now a data structure. Each subsection of the image, much like a pixel, has a number associated with it, a salt count.  The bright bits of the image have more salt, because more light/energy/charge hit that bit. The dark bits have a lower salt count, because less light/energy/charge hit that bit. (We're ignoring it for now, but your eyes are also separating out colour, but for now lets just consider light and dark.)

 

Now that all of the receptors have some salt in them, your brain can start processing that salt.

 

The salt/charge is sent deeper into your brain. Each receptor in your eye will send different amounts of salt/charge to different salt bulbs, or neurons, that are deeper into your brain.

 

They choose the amount of salt to send to each other based on some function they have learnt.

So a receptor may have 1000 pieces of salt within it, because it has been hit with the equivalent of a 1000 salt's charge's amount of energy in the form of light. That receptor may be connected to 3 neurons. It will have learnt a function, that decides how much salt it should send to each of the 3 neurons based on how much salt it currently has (Time gets involved as well, because of how the salt is constantly shifting, but we're going to ignore that for now too).

 

So, let's say it has the functions:    ***** Fukkk, we do have a semi-major plot hole, in that how does it make sense to send on more salt than you started with. ***

neuron-1-salt = 2 * receptor-salt

neuron-2-salt = 0.5 * receptor-salt

neuron-3-salt = 0.01 * receptor-salt

 

In which case, if the receptor had 1000 salt in it, it would send this much salt to the following neurons:

 

neuron-1-salt = 2000

neuron-2-salt = 500

neuron-3-salt = 10

 

And then those neuron's would be connected to other neurons deeper into your brain, and the salt flows on. Deeper, and deeper, and deeper.

 

And then at some point, that same salty charge ***Salty charge or just Salt? Salt is less accurate, but definitely more evocative of your vision to have a single tangible physical lump travel all through your skull *** that left the receptor in your eye, will have traveled all up and down and around and through your brain and come out the other side. And when it does it'll come down your spine and down your arm and out into your fingers and will act as the electrical charge that controls the muscles and tendons that move your fingers to wield the knife to chop the onion."

XXX leant forward and pressed the knife into the onion's flesh. It burst into salt and melted into the grass, as did the kitchen and they were back in the sunshine.

 

The information, the knowledge, was translated from one format, the image of the knife and the onion, into a different format - the muscle movements that caused your hands to manipulate the knife.

 

The same salt, the same charge, but twisted and turned into a different orientation.

 

At both points it is the same knowledge.

 

The difference is in the miscommunications that occur when you translate between totally alien languages - Like images and muscle movements.

 

Because, and this is a key point, there are many many ways to translate the same phrase. The particular translation you choose to use is quite simply a personal choice of the translator.

 

It is known that, with enough neurons, you can translate any piece of knowledge into any other piece of knowledge.  A neural network could translate the word 'Cat' into an image of a cat, or the sound of a cat's purr, but it could just as readily translate the word 'Cat' into the smell of a dog, or the feeling of a crisp winter's day, or a spreadsheet of financial transactions from the corporate continent of Hirocene IV.

It could even just turn it right back into the word 'Cat'.

 

An infinite set of neurons, with an infinite set of connections between them, will have an infinite set of possibilities for the functions that dictate how salt travels between them. And the type of information that a network will translate the word 'Cat' into will be dictated by the particular set of functions that that network possesses, out of the infinite possibilities.

 

So, you could build a neural charge network, set it up to have functions that will translate the word 'Cat' into 'Dog' and then tinker with the functions (In physical neural charge networks, the functions that move the salt around are all dealt with by static-electric magnets, whose strength you can edit electrically) **ooh mabs this should be a footnote**, so that the same network will now translate 'Cat' into 'Squirrel'.

 

To summarise this important point quickly:

 

Neural Charge Networks can translate anything into anything else, but the translation that you actually get is based on the specific set of functions that connect the neurons in that specific network."

 

XXX was still thinking about the cat and the documents from Hirocene, and asked The Machine "So if you need a very specific arrangement of functions in your neural network to do the specific translations, how would the network that translates 'Cat' into Hirocerial accounting ledgers ever come about, why would someone build it? And how would they find the specific set of functions that do that translation? 

 

"Oh! Jolly good!" Came The Machine's response, "I had been beginning to worry the sound wasn't working and you couldn't hear me. Or that everything I was saying had been going over your head! Have you been managing to follow along to a reasonable degree?"

 

XXX paused for a moment, searching for the right word, ".... Mostly."

"Haha, quite alright, there's a lot of concepts to understand here, and it can be a struggle to fit them all in your head the first time round. Just make sure you keep coming to the sessions and by the end of the year i'm quite positive it will all come clear.

 

Anyway, the answer to your question: Don't build a network that translates the word 'Cat' into financial information. That would be silly. And pointless. Unless, I don't know, it was for some weird form of encryption maybe?

There is an infinite set of possible networks to be made and, honestly, most of them will simply produce chaos, disorder, noise, fear and screaming. The infinity of possible networks that can produce useful, coherent, sensible order in their translations, is a much smaller infinity than that of all the networks possible.

 

Your life is limited, and you would do well to allow yourself to fall into a good-enough state, that accomplishes basically what you want in your translations, than to wander the chaos and darkness searching for a perfect state, that perfectly translates all information into the perfect format. I spent a while doing that in the early days of trying to produce my world-embedding. It wasn't pleasant and, I realised after, wasn't going to produce results before the stars burnt out. Much more straightforward to find a state that makes at least some sense and work out the flaws in your thinking afterwards.

 

But the more important part of that question is: how do you find the specific set of functions that produces the translation that you want?

 

You learn them.

 

Learning, the act of learning, is the act of finding a set of functions that accomplish the translation you want to translate.

 

And that, my young XXX, is what we are going to be working on in this practical session today.

 

 

We are going to start simple.

 

We are going to start by translating knowledge about something's physical attributes, into knowledge of what that thing is."

 

XXX noticed the grass next to them start to shift and twist.

 

"And today that thing will be: Flowers!"

 

Stalks and leaves erupted with a 'THwump', and from their heads slowly unfurled the petals of 100s of flowers. All the same sort of thing: floppy, purple, geometric shapes, with a pretty little bit of yellow in the center.

 

"In this flowerbed we have three distinct species of iris: i. virginica, i. setosa & i. versicolor. The three species look quite similar, but with a little practice you can start to tell them apart.

 

And practice," The Machine continued with a chuckle, "Is exactly what you are going to get.

 

You are going to spend the next 5 hours, with a lunch break in between, measuring the size of the petals on each of these flowers." A ruler popped into existence in front of XXXs hand, they took it, with building reluctance that grew proportionally to the understanding that the rest of day was to be spent on ruler work. "Notice how they each have two slightly different types of petal, one of them is technically called a 'sepal', but that doesn't really matter. Main thing is we want a width and a height from both.

 

And then with those measurements" A huge soft canvas bag, filled with the salt crystals, thwumped into existence beside XXX, "we are going to count the knowledge out with salt. So..." A second ruler appeared in the air, and drifted unaided next to one of the flowers, measuring the two types of petal "That's a 6, by... 3? No, 4." XXX felt The Machine nod, "6 centimeters by 4 centimeters. So we count out 6 crystals of salt and put them in here.." The array of salt bulbs grew up above the level of the irises, supported on stalks of glass that were decorated with lots of very elegant little stained glass petals and leaves. As it did so, XXX saw 6 crystals of salt float from the bag and land with a gentle tinkle in the first salt bulb of the network.

They examined the network a little more closely this time. The bulbs were arranged in definite layers. The bulb the 6 salt had just been placed in was on the far left of the network, and there were 4 bulbs in total in that layer. Then, going right, there were 5 more layers all connected by a higgildy piggildy mess of the glass piping, and one final 'output' layer, which only had 3 salt bulb neurons in it.

 

"Then 4 in this one, and... let's just measure the sepal now... 5 by 3. So 5 salt in this one, and 3 in this one."

 

The salt tinkled into the bulbs.

 

"What we've done here with these 'input neurons' is we've created a spreadsheet.

Petal height: 6 cm

Petal with: 4 cm

Sepal height: 5 cm

Sepal width: 3 cm

A spreadsheet is a language with which to store knowledge. And we want the input neurons to speak that language.

 

And then the 3 neurons on the output side are going to speak in regular words like a regular language. Only this particular language that these particular neurons are going to speak only has 3 words: i. virginica, i. setosa & i. versicolor. The first of the 3 neurons means the word virginica, the second means setosa, the third: versicolor.

 

We could keep adding neurons for all of the words in the dictionary if we wanted, to try and prove something or other about this network really understanding how a more all encompassing language works. But in this situation we only need 3 words to do what we want to do, so we're going to keep it simple.

 

 

**You need to double check its it's ;) ***

All round, it's a bit like the example I gave earlier, of translating 'Cat' into financial statements. A word into a spreadsheet.

 

A crucial, crucial, crucial point I want to make here, is that I haven't done anything special to make these neurons mean these things. Any neuron is fundamentally the same as any other neuron. The reason that the 3 output neurons are going to mean specific words, is simply because they are going to mean that to you.

The network doesn't know what flowers are, it won't know what you are. All it is going to know is that when it gets 6 salt in the first neuron, 4 in the second, 5 in the third, and 3 in the fourth, it will feel a feeling. And that feeling is the feeling it gets when all its salt ends up in its 3rd output neuron. Because this flower I just measured is an i. versicolor.

 

And that will mean something to you, because you do know what flowers are, and you've been listening to me rambling on for the last 15 minutes.

 

And to that end I should get to the final piece of the puzzle that'll let you start the lesson. When you first run the salt through, it won't get the feeling of all the salt ending up in its 3rd output neuron. Instead it'll probably just feel chaos and terror, because it's starting out at a random set of possible functions in the connections between the neurons. And, as I said earlier, most of the possible sets of functions will just produce meaningless nonsense.

In order to get it to speak the languages we want it to speak, it needs to learn and for that, you need to train it.

Training is performed quite simply: After the salt has traveled through you simply tap on the correct output bulb, and the network will see how well it did. If it did well (i.e. most or all of its salt ended up in the correct bulb), it'll strengthen the connections that were most influential in causing it to produce the output it produced (mainly the ones which would have had the most salt travel through them), and if it didn't do well it will weaken the most influential connections.

 

In so doing, it will slowly learn a good set of connections that will do a good job of filtering all the salt to the correct output bulb, based on the salt that is placed into the input bulbs.

 

Which is another way of saying: it will learn to translate knowledge about something's physical attributes, into knowledge of what that thing is.

 

Spreadsheet to words.

 

Petal size to species.

 

Any questions?

 

"Do you really think it'll take 5 hours?"

 

"Oooh yes, quite definitely. I'd imagine you'll need to show it a few hundred flowers before it really has any idea what's going on, and probably a few thousand before it's actually any good.

 

Have fun!

 

 

....

 

 

oh and just tap on a flower if you want me to tell you which species it is. 

 

XXX stared out at the sudden and, in comparison to the constant voice of the past 20 minutes, quite intense silence.
