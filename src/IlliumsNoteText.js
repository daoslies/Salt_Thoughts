In the darkness is a void. 
  
</p>

<p>
And in the void is nothing.
</p>
<p>
There’s always been a desire to know where ideas live. And people have always quite liked the idea that their ideas live outside of themselves.
Even the humans wanted to think this way. 
</p>
<p>
I read an article recently from one of the xenoarchaeology ships about this human called Plato, who had a whole thing where there was some space, separate to our physical world, where the fundamental and eternal form of everything lived. All our trees and fables and chairs were just references to the ideal idea of trees and fables and chairs that lived in this ephemeral space. 
</p>
<p>
And maybe that links them to us, over all the space and time with which we’re separated. Our chairs and their chairs are references to the same universal chair. All our hopes and dreams and loves and losses are sampled from this great space that is apart from us, but that we can all touch if we just think about it in the right way.

<p>
I’ll miss you.
<p/>
<p>
And I’m sure you’ll miss me. Which I can only apologise for. 
<p/>
<p>
But I think this is an adventure, an experiment, an exploration that’s worth investigating. 
<p/>
<p>
And all I ask is that when you make your way to the Alabaster Institute (and well done you on getting in <3 ) is that you use the knowledge you find to try and find me.
<p/>
<p>
I’m sure I’ll be hanging around somewhere in the Plato space playing tennis or sipping on juice or doing literally everything, because that’s how infinity works.
<p/>
<p>
<b>And</b> if not. <b>And</b> every<b>thing</b> that I <b>am</b> lives in<b>side</b> the <b>salt</b> that the <b>heart</b> in my <b>brain</b> pumps a<b>round</b> my head, then that’s cool too.
<p/>
<p>
I wasn’t really going anywhere and I’m kind of done trying.
<p/>
<p>
Love you,
<p/>
<p>
